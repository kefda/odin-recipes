    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      What if I told you that you DON’T need to melt chocolate or chocolate
      chips with butter together to make brownies, AND you don’t need two
      separate bowls.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and HOT</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil, (olive oil or coconut oil are fine)</li>
      <li>
        1 1/8 cup superfine sugar, (caster sugar or white granulated sugar)*
      </li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all purpose (or plain) flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking oil spray. Line
        with parchment paper (or baking paper); set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine hot melted butter, oil and sugar together in a medium-sized
        bowl. Whisk well for about a minute. Add the eggs and vanilla; beat
        until lighter in colour (another minute).
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients
        into the wet ingredients until JUST combined (do NOT over beat as doing
        so well affect the texture of your brownies).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly. (OPTIONAL:
        Top with chocolate chunks or chocolate chips.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre of the brownies in the pan
        no longer jiggles and is just set to the touch (the brownies will keep
        baking in the hot pan out of the oven). If testing with a toothpick, the
        toothpick should come out dirty for fudge-textured brownies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing into 16
        brownies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>OPTIONAL ADD INS:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Crushed walnuts, peanuts, almonds, pecans, chocolate chips, peanut
        butter chips, chocolate chunks, dried fruit (cranberries, raisins, etc)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >*Regular white, granulated, sugar can be used if you can't find caster
        sugar. For even fudgier brownies, use half white and half light brown
        sugar!</em
